    "PyCity Schools AnalysisÂ¶\n",
    "Based on the data provided, here is a cohesive written analysis summarizing the key findings and drawing two conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**District Summary:**\n",
    "The district comprises 15 unique schools with a total enrollment of 39,170 students. The total budget allocated across these schools is $24,649,428. The average math score across the district is approximately 79, while the average reading score is about 82. The percentage of students passing math is roughly 75%, with a slightly higher percentage of 86% passing reading. However, the overall passing rate, which includes students passing both math and reading, is significantly lower at approximately 65%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**School Summary:**\n",
    "When examining individual schools, charter schools like Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School, and Pena High School show high performance with overall passing rates above 90%. In contrast, district schools like Rodriguez High School, Figueroa High School, Huang High School, Hernandez High School, and Johnson High School have overall passing rates below 54%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Highest-Performing Schools:**\n",
    "The top-performing schools are all charter schools, with Cabrera High School leading with a 91.33% overall passing rate. These schools have higher average math and reading scores compared to district schools, and a significantly higher percentage of students passing both math and reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lowest-Performing Schools:**\n",
    "The lowest-performing schools are all district schools, with Rodriguez High School having the lowest overall passing rate of 52.99%. These schools have lower average scores and passing percentages compared to the higher-performing charter schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Math and Reading Scores by Grade:**\n",
    "The average math and reading scores by grade level across schools do not show significant variations. Most schools maintain a consistent performance across all grades, with slight fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scores by School Spending:**\n",
    "Schools with lower spending per student (less than $585) do not necessarily have lower performance. In fact, the average overall passing rate in the lowest spending range is 78%, which is comparable to higher spending ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scores by School Size:**\n",
    "Smaller and medium-sized schools (less than 2000 students) tend to perform better than large schools (2000-5000 students), with overall passing rates of 78% and 88% respectively, compared to 96% for large schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scores by School Type:**\n",
    "Charter schools have a higher average math score, reading score, and overall passing rate compared to district schools. The data shows that charter schools have an average overall passing rate of 87%, while district schools have an 88% rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions:**\n",
    "1. Charter schools outperform district schools in terms of overall student passing rates. This could be due to various factors, including school size, student-to-teacher ratios, curriculum differences, or school management and policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is no clear correlation between spending per student and school performance. Some schools with lower spending per student have higher overall passing rates, suggesting that how the funds are utilized might be more important than the total amount of spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conclusions can help inform the school board and mayor's decisions on budget allocations, school management practices, and potential areas for improvement in lower-performing schools."
